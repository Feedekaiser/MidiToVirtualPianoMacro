# Midi to Virtual Piano

Fork of https://github.com/Stereo101/python-MidiToVirtualPianoMacro/


**WINDOWS ONLY!!!**

## Instruction:
Put your `midi` files in the `midi` folder, then run `MidiAutoPlayer.exe` after running `pyMIDI.py` to convert a `midi` file of your choosing to `song.txt`



## Compile:
Haven't test on anything other than MSVC, but SHOULD work on GNU and Clang. It is single file only so 

```
clang++|gcc MidiAutoPlayer.cpp -o MidiAutoPlayer.exe
```
should work.
